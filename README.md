My attempt at almost automating the process of applying to "Easy Apply" jobs.

## Summary:
- Edit `qa.json` (for answers to pre-selected questions) and `info.py` to your liking.
- Run `autoApplyLinkedIn.py` to apply to jobs in LinkedIn.

Keep in mind I used the word "almost", because some data has to be inputted manually (like some form questions and sign-in security questions). If you have encountered any errors, please let me know at uzair.99@hotmail.com.
